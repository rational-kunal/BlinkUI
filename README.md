# BlinkUI: A SwiftUI-Inspired Terminal UI Framework

BlinkUI is an experimental terminal UI framework that brings SwiftUI's declarative syntax and component-based architecture to terminal applications. Build beautiful, interactive terminal UIs using familiar SwiftUI-like patterns.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is an experimental project, currently in active development. While functional, it's not yet recommended for production use. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- **SwiftUI-like Syntax**: Write terminal UIs using familiar declarative syntax
- **Rich Component Library**: Built-in components like Text, Button, HStack, VStack, and ZStack
- **State Management**: Support for @State, @Binding, and @Environment property wrappers
- **Focus Engine**: Keyboard navigation between interactive elements (Tab/Shift+Tab)
- **View Modifiers**: Padding, borders, and frame customization
- **Layout System**: Flexible layout engine for component positioning

## Quick Example

```swift
import BlinkUI

struct Example: App {
    @State var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        Text("This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.")
        if !isSelected {
            HStack {
                Button(action: { isSelected = true }) { Text("Blue pill") }
                Button(action: { isSelected = true }) { Text("Red pill") }
            }
        } else {
            Text("The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us.")
        }
    }
}

// Run the app
let engine = AppEngine(app: Example())
engine.run()
```

### View Modifiers

Powerful modifiers to customize your components:

#### Frame
Control the dimensions and alignment of your components.

</div>

#### Padding
Add space around your components for better layout control.

### State Management
Reactive state management with property wrappers (@State, @Binding, @Environment).

## Getting Started

> Coming Soon: Installation and usage instructions will be added as the project stabilizes.

## Contributing

This project is open for experimentation and learning. If you're interested in terminal UI frameworks or SwiftUI internals, feel free to take a look at the code and provide feedback.

## Technical Details

The framework consists of over 2,000 lines of code implementing:
- Custom ViewBuilder for declarative syntax
- Node-based layout system
- State management system
- Focus engine for accessibility
- Terminal rendering engine

> TODO: A detailed technical blog post about the implementation and learnings is planned.

## Why This Project?

BlinkUI started as a deep dive into understanding SwiftUI's architecture. Instead of just reading about SwiftUI or building another todo app, I decided to challenge myself by recreating its core concepts for terminal applications. This hands-on approach provided invaluable insights into:

- How declarative UI frameworks actually work under the hood
- The complexities of state management and data flow
- The challenges of building a layout engine from scratch
- Real-world application of property wrappers and function builders
